        <p>This Explainer accompanies the drafts of the W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id='sotd'>
        <p>This is an updated draft of the WCAG 3.0 Explainer. It is not normative (informative) and is not expected to
            become a W3C Recommendation. It provides background on [[[WCAG3]]].</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 is a successor to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 [[WCAG22]]
            and previous versions. It does not deprecate WCAG 2. It may incorporate content from User Agent
            Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [[UAAG20]] and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [[ATAG20]]. These
            versions provided a model that kept them relevant for over 10 years. Changing technology and changing needs
            of people with disabilities require a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively.
        </p>
        <p>This Explainer includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Goals for WCAG 3.0;</li>
            <li>WCAG 3.0 background and development history;</li>

    <section>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of WCAG is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products on a
            variety of platforms. WCAG 3.0 will use a model that allows it to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>address more disability needs than WCAG 2,</li>
            <li>incorporate publishing requirements and emerging technologies such as web XR (augmented, virtual and
                mixed reality) and voice input,</li>
            <li>facilitate maintenance, so that the new model will be more enduring over time as technologies evolve,
                and</li>
            <li>include additional information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user
                agents, and assistive technologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional goals for WCAG 3.0 are written in <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">Requirements for WCAG 3</a>. These are based on the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Silver_Research_Archive">Silver research</a>, the
            results from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/">Silver Design
                Sprint</a>, and input from the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, the Silver Task Force, and the
            Silver Community Group.</p>

        <h3>Goals for Inclusion</h3>
        <p>The creation process for the guidelines should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Actively recruit a diverse range of people with disabilities. Review and monitor whether people are
                included. Periodically evaluate inclusive features of available tooling and procedures.</li>
            <li>Facilitate global participation and feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="ednote">
            <p>W3C strives to be as inclusive as possible, and has actively sought participation and input from a broad
                range of stakeholder groups. We recognize, however, that there is always room for improvement in
                practices to support inclusion and representation. As you evaluate this document, please consider
                whether there are ways the Working Group can better support your review, feedback, or inclusion within
                the process of creating this standard. We welcome feedback on this question as part of your comments.
            </p>

        <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>Several items are out of scope for WCAG 3.0:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-web technologies.</li>
            <li>Normative requirements for platforms, operating systems, software in the web technology stack, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WCAG 3.0 Background and Development History</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 originally had a project name of "Silver", so the original groups working on it and much of the
            early design work carries that project name. The Silver Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working
            Group (AG) and the W3C Silver Community group partnered to produce the needs, requirements, and structure
            for the new accessibility guidance. They worked on Silver from 2017-2023. During that time they:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Developed a list of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <a

        <h2>Current Process for Creating WCAG 3.0</h2>
        <p>The AG takes an iterative approach to creating WCAG 3.0. Each piece of content will evolve over time,
            increasing in maturity. As a result, the document is a work-in-progress.</p>
        <p>Because different parts of the document have different maturity levels, each normative section includes a
            status that indicates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how far along in the development process this section is,</li>
            <li>how ready it is for experimental adoption, and</li>
            <li>what kind of feedback we are looking for.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The status indicators, from least to most mature, are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary. It shows the type of content or section to
                expect. Placeholder text will be replaced. By default it is not included in the Editor's draft. No
                feedback is needed on placeholder content.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory</strong>: The Working Group is exploring what direction to take with this content.
                This content is not refined; details and definitions may be missing. By default it is not included in
                the Editor's draft. We invite feedback on the proposed direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Developing</strong>: There is rough agreement on what is needed for this section, although not
                all high-level concerns have been settled. Details are included, yet they are not all agreed on. We
                invite feedback on how understandable, usable, and reasonable the section is generally.</li>
            <li><strong>Refining</strong>: The Working Group has reached consensus on this section. It is ready for
                broad public review and experimental adoption. We seek feedback on feasibility and issues with
                implementations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mature</strong>: The Working Group thinks this content is ready for the final standard. Feedback
                should be focused on edge case scenarios the Working Group might not have anticipated.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The working group aims to publish two new drafts each year, alternating focus between the guidelines and the
            conformance approach. Each draft will include targeted questions for the public to consider and respond to
            in order to advance the working draft. Content will evolve and there may be changes to layout and style that
            are not yet reflected in all parts of the present release and will be reflected in future releases.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="structure">
        <h2>Draft WCAG 3.0 Structure</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 includes both normative and informative guidance. This guidance is organized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Guidelines (Outcome Statements) - normative
                <ul>
                    <li>Foundational Requirements - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Methods - informative</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Supplemental Requirements - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Methods - informative</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Assertions - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Methods - informative</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Details on each are below.</p>
        <p>By default, guidelines are organized by what is tested. WCAG 3.0 will provide a version, similar to the
            existing <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/">QuickRef</a>, that incorporates tags to allow
            readers to reorganize and filter the content. For example, content will be tagged Perceivable, Operable,
            Understandable, and Robust so that readers can view WCAG 3.0 criteria in the same structure as WCAG 2.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>Guidelines are written as plain language, user-centered outcomes statements.</p>
        <p>Guidelines include high-level, plain-language information for managers, policy makers, individuals who are
            new to accessibility, and other individuals who need to understand the concepts but not the technical
            details. They provide an easy-to-understand way of organizing and presenting the outcomes so that anyone can
            learn about and understand the concepts. </p>
        <p>Guidelines are normative.</p>
        <p>Guidelines are technology-agnostic and address functional needs on specific topics, such as contrast, forms, readability, and more.
          Foundational requirements, supplemental requirements, and assertions that relate 
            to a Guideline are listed together to encourage adoption of higher levels of accessibility.</p>

        <div class="ednote">
            <p>Within the current draft, requirements and assertions are organized within the Guidelineas a decision tree to
                assist readers in determining which Requirements and Assertions to use. The AG requests feedback on two
                early draft examples of this approach, Focus Appearance and Text Alternatives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does grouping related Requirements and Assertions make it easier to understand the Guidelines?</li>
                <li>The AG has discussed also including recommendations which could help improve accessibility under guidelines. 
                    Recommendations are not be testable and would not contribute to conformance.
                </li>
                <li>How can this approach be improved?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Requirements and Methods</h3>
        <p>Each guideline contains multiple requirements:
            <ul><li>Foundational Requirements will be used to test the most basic level of accessibilty.  This set of requirements will
                cover a similar, but not identical, set of needs as WCAG 2.2 A & AA.</li>
                <li>Supplemental Requirements will be used for higher levels of conformance.</li>
            </li></ul></p>    
         <p>Requiremenets reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Requirements are designed for use 
            by developers, testers, and other technical specialists.</p>
        <p>Requirements are normative.</p>

        <p>Each Requirement is associated with at least one <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-method">Method</a>.
            Methods are informative. Each method contains techniques for meeting the outcome, examples, resources, and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-set-of-tests">sets of tests</a>. Methods can apply to a
            specific technology, such as HTML, or can be more generic where the advice applies no matter what
            technology. For example, the methods supporting the Clear Language guideline.</p>

            <div class="ednote">
                <p>AG will continue developing requirements and methods. Each publication will include additional or more mature examples
                    for public comment. 
                </p>
                <p>Next steps include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define criteria for which requirements are foundational and which are supplemental,</li>
                    <li>Develop mature examples of 2 guidelines, requirements, methods and tests,</li>
                    <li>Work on moving all guidelines to the developing stage,</li>
                    <li>As we develop example outcomes and methods, further explore conditions and how multiple measurements
                        might be used to meet an outcome.</li>
                    <li>Address all GitHub issues under <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/milestone/16">test types and
                            terminology milestone</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <h3>Assertions</h3>
            <p>An assertion is a formal claim of fact, attributed to a person or organization. In WCAG 3.0, an
                <a>assertion</a>is an attributable and documented statement of fact regarding procedures practiced in the
                development and maintenance of the content or product to improve accessibility.</p>
    
            <h4>Using assertions</h4>
            <p>Assertions may supplement Outcomes to meet a Guideline. Not all Guidelines include Assertions. Those that do
                list the Assertions with the Outcomes. Organizations can make an assertion that they followed a procedure to
                claim conformance. Results when testing assertions are true/false - the organization making the assertion
                either provided the required documentation or it did not.</p>
            <p>Procedures used in assertions may be implemented at the organization level, during design and development, or
                during testing.</p>
            <p>Examples of procedures that may be used during implementation might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Training,</li>
                <li>FTE (Full Time Equivalent) assignments,</li>
                <li>Skills testing,</li>
                <li>Coordination and documentation of accessibility processes, or</li>
                <li>Setting the priority for remediation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of procedures that may be used to evaluate accessibility might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Usability testing,</li>
                <li>Heuristic evaluation, or</li>
                <li>Testing with assistive technology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Supporting documentation for assertions</h4>
            <p>WCAG recommends maintaining additional information that an organization can use to improve or validate
                procedures and assertions. WCAG will not require organizations to provide supporting documentation to
                conform.</p>
            <h4>Testing assertions</h4>
            <p>The quality of an assertion can be tested based on how well the assertion meets the documentation
                requirements for assertions (See <a>Documenting Assertions</a>). Conforming to WCAG does not require testing
                supporting documentation; however, organizations may decide to adopt additional documentation requirements
                based on the procedure being asserted.</p>

        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <h5>Types of tests</h5>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantifiable tests: Tests where there is a high degree of reliability between test results from different
                testers. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a
                value specified by the requirement.</li>
            <li>Qualitative tests: Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results
                may vary between testers who understand the criteria. Variation can be reduced with clear guidance. 
                One example is evaluating the quality of alternative text used to meet a requirement for alternative text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most tests have prescribed ways to meet the test. In some cases, the ways to meet the test will change based
            on a specific condition being met. For example, different human languages have different readability
            metrics.</p>
        
        <h5>Example Tests</h5>
        <p>Tests may be objective or subjective. For example, from WCAG 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/23a2a8/">Image has
                    non-empty accessible name</a></li>
            <li>Example for 1.4.3: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/afw4f7/proposed/">Text
                    has minimum contrast</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both these tests are objectively verifiable. They are not subject to variation of results between different
            testers.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Alternatively, again from WCAG 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example for 1.1.1: <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/qt1vmo/proposed/">Image accessible name
                    is descriptive</a></li>
            <li>Example for 2.4.6: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/cc0f0a/proposed">Form
                    field label is descriptive</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These tests include a subjective determination of whether they are adequately met.</p>

        <h4>Test scopes</h4>
        <p>Testing outcomes use <a>items</a>, <a>views</a>, <a>task flow</a>, and the <a>product</a> to define what is
            being tested.</p>
        <p>Items are the smallest testable unit. They could be interactive components such as a drop down menu, a link,
            or a media player. They could also be units of content such as a phrase, a paragraph, a label or error
            message, an icon, or an image.</p>
        <p>Views include all content visually and programmatically available without a significant change. Conceptually,
            views correspond to the definition of a web page as used in WCAG 2, but are not restricted to content
            meeting that definition. For example, a view could be considered a “screen” in a mobile app or a layer of
            web content, such as a modal dialog.</p>
        <p>Task flows are a series views that support a specified user activity. A task flow may include a subset of
            items in a view or a group of views. Only the part of the views that support the user activity are included
            in a test of the task flow.</p>

        <p>Examples of a task flow include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Logging into a web site and being verified as a user;</li>
            <li>Ordering an item, including the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the
                shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
            <li>Submitting tax information; and</li>
            <li>Chatting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The product is the combination of all items, views, and task flows that comprise the web site, set of web
            pages, web app, etc.</p>

        <h4>Conditions</h4>
        <p>Some tests only apply in certain situations. Testing may occasionally require determining and referencing
            which specifications are being tested. Methods will note whether a test always applies or under what
            conditions a test applies. Both quantitative and qualitative tests can be conditional.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#example-3">Example 3</a></p>
        <p>Example conditions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The language used may have different grammatical rules.</li>
            <li>An interface with multiple contrast modes may have different contrast requirements than an interface
                with only a default contrast mode.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assertions and procedures</h2>
        <div class="ednote">
            <p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can assertions be used to record accessibility work that is not required in the guidelines? This
                    could include advance work on guidance not yet added to the guidelines.</li>
                <li>What optional supporting documentation should organizations provide with an assertion?</li>
                <li>Is there a need for WCAG 3.0 to require proof of an assertion, and if so, what documentation should
                    be required as proof?</li>
                <li>Should assertions be dated, expire, or be reviewed on a regular basis?</li>
                <li>Can steps in a procedure duplicate tests in other parts of the guidelines? If so, how should those
                    be handled?</li>
                <li>Can assertions exist outside of conformance? For example, can they be used as an internal benchmark
                    rather than for a claim of conformance?</li>
                <li>Can assertions be used at the most basic level of conformance? If so, how?</li>
                <li>How can small organizations use assertions without unrealistic burden?</li>
                <li>As written, outcomes and assertions are at the same level. Would moving assertions to the test level
                    be more effective?</li>
                <li>AG is considering whether and how assertions can be applied to the Bronze level.</li>
                <li>AG is considering what will qualify as a procedurein WCAG 3.0. A procedure may be limited to
                    guidance:</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>approved by AG and listed in WCAG,</li>
                <li>that references publicly published guidance, or</li>
                <li>that meets criteria specified in WCAG</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>or it may be any process that an organization uses to improve accessibility. Comments or criticism
                    of these alternatives is welcome.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

 

        <h4>Documenting assertions</h4>
        <p>Assertions must be documented as part of the conformance claim process. The required information may also be
            made available through the web site.</p>
        <p>Assertions might include the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The statement being asserted,</li>
            <li>The date of the assertion,</li>
            <li>The date or date range the procedure was completed,</li>
            <li>The scope of the assertion,</li>
            <li>Contact information for the person or group making the assertion,and</li>
            <li>The outcome(s) or guideline(s) supported by the assertion.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="ednote">
            <p>An alternative to specifying assertions at the outcome or guideline level might be to require that the
                assertion apply to the scope of the conformance claim.</p>
        </div>


    </section>

    <section id="conformance-models">
        <h2> Conformance Models </h2>
        <div class="ednote">
            <p>We are proposing 1(2) model(s) within the current draft and request public comment on these models.
                Questions to consider include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the level of effort to meet this conformance model acceptable?</li>
                <li>How well does this conformance model reflect the actual accessibility of the content being assessed?
                </li>
                <li>How well does this conformance model ensure inclusion across different disabilities?</li>
                <li>What are the pros and cons of this conformance model?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>WCAG 3.0 will use a different conformance model than WCAG 2.0 in order to meet its requirements. Developing
            and vetting the conformance model is a large portion of the work AG needs to complete over the next few
            years. Drafts will include maturity models for public review and comment. Key concepts we are exploring
            include conformance levels, issue severity, percentages, and levels of severity.</p>

        <h3>Conformance levels</h3>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 defines three levels of conformance: bronze, silver, and gold. These do not replicate the WCAG 2 A,
            AA, AAA levels. The new conformance levels take a more advanced approach to make it clearer what they
            reflect. Part of this change is to enable exemplary organizations to demonstrate the work that they are
            doing.</p>
        <p><strong>Bronze</strong> is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the
            bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. To reach Bronze level, the scope claimed in the conformance
            statement must pass a subset of outcomes and assertions. The subset will require enough outcomes and
            assertions to improve equity across <a>functional needs</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Silver</strong> level incentivizes organizations to go further to improve accessibility. One
            possibility that we are examining is that Silver level points can accumulate even prior to completing bronze
            but are not usable until Bronze is achieved. The goal is to encourage organizations to go beyond the
            minimum, especially where organizations want to be recognized for their efforts to go beyond minimum
            accessibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Gold</strong> level identifies measures we want to include for those organizations that do achieve
            Silver so that some can stand out as exemplary, cutting edge, and role models. There are a number of ideas
            that will be developed further once more of the conformance structure is solidified.</p>

        <h3>Issue severity</h3>
        <div class="ednote">
            <p>Severity rating could contribute towards scoring and prioritization.</p>
            <p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Is every issue critical to someone, making this concept invalid?</li>
                <li>How best to assign severity, particularly if testers have different ideas on what is critical?</li>
                <li>How do we incorporate context/process/task? Is that part of scoping, or issue severity? Both are
                    important to the end result.</li>
                <li>What to do with non-critical issues?</li>
                <li>If included, how will situations where severity depends on context be handled?</li>
                <li>Can the matrix inform designation of functional categories? For example, the <a
                        href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2021/outcomes/text-alternative-available">Text Alternative
                        Available outcome</a>.</li>
                <li>How will issue severity fit into levels? For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>“Bronze” could be an absence of any critical or high issues;</li>
                        <li>“Silver” could be an absence of any critical, high, or medium issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How to account for cumulative issues becoming critical?</li>
                <li>Would another approach be more effective, for example assigning critical issues after testing is
                    complete based on task or type of task rather than by test?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Next steps include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Testing the assumption that some failures cause a greater impact to users than others or whether all
                    guidelines and contexts are important to some individuals.</li>
                <li>Explore whether the concept of issue severity can be applied consistently and effectively.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Outcomes may allow for the concept of varying severity. High severity issues are those which prevent users
            from completing task flows.</p>
        <p>Tests could include critical issues. Each test could have a category of severity, so some tests will be
            flagged as causing a critical issue.</p>

        <h3>Adjectival ratings</h3>
        <p> <a>Adjectival Ratings</a>allow test results to go beyond Pass or Fail to show progress towards a goal or
            exceeding a goal. Example of possible adjectival ratings are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fail, Pass, Exceptional; or</li>
            <li>Fail, Progress, Pass, Better, Exceptional.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outcomes or guidelines could be evaluated using adjectival ratings on both directly
            <a>quantifiable</a>outcomes and <a>qualitative</a>measures that are asserted. Outcomes might be assigned an
            adjectival rating based on methods used to meet the outcome and issue severity. Guidelines might be assigned
            an adjectival rating based on the outcomes and completed under the guideline.</p>

        <h3>Percentages</h3>
        <div class="ednote">
            <p>We are exploring whether percentages could apply to Bronze but have not found a model to date where this
                works without adding complexity and time needed for testing.</p>
            <p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How can percentages be used in a way that is equitable across disabilities?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>In this approach, percentage of outcomes and assertions passed or percentage passed at a certain adjectival
            rating might be used to conform to Silver and Gold levels.</p>

        <h3>Pre-assessment checks</h3>
        <p>Pre-Assessment checks are tests or criteria that implementers can use to determine if they are ready to
            assess conformance. The intent of specifying these would be to help implementers prepare for conformance
            testing, not to create a new level of conformance. Examples of pre-assessment checks might be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The video player used has the ability to display captions and support multiple audio tracks,</li>
            <li>All non-text elements on a page have an accessible name.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="schedule">
        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>AG is currently <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/11/ag-charter">chartered</a> through November 2025. The
            schedule through that time period is maintained at <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_3_Timeline#Publication_Plan">WCAG 3.0 Timeline</a>.</p>
        <p>AG will continue to iterate within a single normative document with informative supporting documentation.
            After exploring other options such as breaking the content's into modules, the group determined that the
            fastest way forward at this time is to continue creating a single document with varying levels of maturity.
            We will revisit whether mature content can be published as informative modules as part of the next charter
            period, when content is more mature.</p>
        <p>A final schedule will be delivered as part of this charter period. WCAG 3.0 will not be published until it
            covers at least as much as WCAG 2.2.</p>
