## What to do

<div class="nested">

1. Remove, hide, or mask the image.
2. Replace it with the text alternative.
3. Check that the meaning is substantively equivalent 
    1. the purpose of the non-text content is met by the text alternative.
    2. The way the content is presented is using the most appropriate, accessibility-supported  (math, code samples, etc.)
4. If the non-text content contains words that are important to understanding the content, the words are included in the text alternative.
5. If the non-text content duplicates adjacent text, the alternative may be null.
