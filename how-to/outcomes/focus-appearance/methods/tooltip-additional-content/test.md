* **Sufficient Size:** The thickness/length of the focus indicator change is [a sufficient size to be noticeable]. 
    * Editor’s note: We will use a metric of 2px of the perimeter -20% as a starting point. This metric needs usability testing, please get in touch if you could help facilitate this.
    * Note: Text within a control is not considered part of the size metric. 
* **Change of contrast:** The contrast change of the pixels that indicate the keyboard focus is [sufficient] in a) standard mode, b) dark mode, and  c) high contrast mode.
    * Editor’s note: The contrast metric is to be determined, but assumed to be similar to a large-text level.
* **Adjacent Contrast:** The focus indicator has sufficient contrast with the adjacent colors in a) standard mode, b) dark mode, and c) high contrast mode
    * Editor’s Note: There is a relationship between the area of the focus indicator and contrast that will need to be clarified. E.g. a higher contrast area may not need to be as large.
    * Note: If the focus indicator is adjacent to the focusable element and does not contrast with the element, it can use the [size change](../../size-change/) method.
