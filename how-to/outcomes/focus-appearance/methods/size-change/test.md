* **Sufficient Size:** The discernable area of the focus indicator change is [sufficient to be noticeable]
    * Editor’s note: We will use a metric of 10% as a starting point. This metric needs usability testing, please get in touch if you could help facilitate this.
    * Note: “discernable area” means the focused element has a discernible border or background, it cannot just be text.
    * Note: Text within a control is not considered part of the size metric.  
* **Contrast:** The contrast change of the pixels that indicate the keyboard focus is sufficient in a) standard mode, b) dark mode, and c) high contrast mode
