			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 will provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other web of things devices. The guidelines apply to various types of web content including static, dynamic, interactive, and streaming content; visual and auditory media; virtual and augmented reality; and alternative access presentation and control. These  guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a>requirements</a> and <a>assertions</a> to determine whether the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each outcome or assertion. </p>
			<p>This specification is expected to be updated regularly to keep pace with changing technology by updating and adding methods, outcomes, and guidelines to address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several levels of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>

			<li>We have developed labels for sections to tell you how confident we are that the content will not change. This lets you tell whether we are trying out an idea or whether we have put a lot of work into the topic and we don’t expect it to change.  There are 5 levels: 
			<ul>
				<li>Placeholder - we are thinking about the topic and plan to work on it in the next few months. </li>
				<li>Exploratory - we have started work on this topic but still have many questions.</li>
				<li>Developing - we have general agreement, but not all the details are worked out. </li>
				<li>Refining - we think we have a good idea and want public feedback about it. We are ready to have a few people try it out and see how well it works. </li>
				<li>Mature - we think it is ready to publish and we want to know if we missed any rare examples. </li>

			<p>What’s new in this version of WCAG 3?</p>

			<p>This draft includes an updated list of the potential outcomes which we are exploring. The list of outcomes is longer than a listing of Success Criteria in WCAG 2.2 because the intent at this stage is to be as inclusive as possible of potential outcomes. The final set of outcomes in WCAG 3 will be different than what is in this draft. Outcomes will be added, combined, and removed. We also expect changes to the text of the Outcomes. Only some of the Outcomes will be required at the base level of conformance.</p>

			<p>The purpose of publishing this initial list is to:
			<ul><li> better understand the scope of needs, </li>
			<li>request assistance in identifying gaps, and</li>
			<li>request assistance locating and conducting research to validate or invalidate the outcomes listed.</li></ul>
			</p>
			<p>We did not make changes to conformance related sections and we did not publish an updated WCAG 3 Explainer. </p>

				<h3>About WCAG 3</h3>
				<p>This specification presents a new model and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 support a wide set of user needs, use new approaches to testing, and allow frequent maintenance of guidelines and related content to keep pace with accelerating technology change. WCAG 3 supports this evolution by focusing on the <a>functional needs</a> of users. These needs are then supported by outcomes and technology-specific methods to meet those needs. </p>
				<p>WCAG 3 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> WCAG 2. It will also incorporate content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/"> User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/"> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible model that kept them relevant for over 15 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities have led to the need for a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly.</p>
				<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2 and WCAG 3. The WCAG 3 guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other web of things devices. The guidelines apply to various types of web content including static, dynamic, interactive, and streaming content; visual and auditory media; virtual and augmented reality; and alternative access presentation and control. These  guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
				<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a>outcomes</a> to determine whether the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each outcome. </p>
				<p>Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 A and AA is expected to meet most of the minimum conformance level of this new standard but, since WCAG 3 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics, additional work will be needed to reach full conformance. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to the new standard, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>

				<h3>Section status levels</h3>
				<p>As part of the WCAG 3 drafting process each normative section of this document is given a status. This status is used to indicate how far along in the development this section is, how ready it is for experimental adoption, and what kind of feedback the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is looking for.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong id="status-placeholder">Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary. It showcases the type of content or section to expect here. All of this is expected to be replaced. No feedback is needed on placeholder content.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-exploratory">Exploratory</strong>: The working group is exploring what direction to take with this section. This content is not refined, details and definitions may be missing. Feedback should be about the proposed direction.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-developing">Developing</strong>: There is rough agreement on what is needed for this section, although not all high-level concerns have been settled. Details have been filled, but are yet to be worked out. Feedback should be focused on ensuring the sections are usable and reasonable in a broad sense.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-refining">Refining</strong>: The working group has reach consensus on this section. It is ready for broad public review and experimental adoption. Feedback should be focused on the feasibility and implementability.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-mature">Mature</strong>: Content is believed by the working group to be ready for recommendation. Feedback should be focused on edge case scenarios the working group may not have anticipated.</li>

			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The following guidelines are being considered for WCAG 3. They are currently a list of topics which we expect to explore more thoroughly in future drafts. The list includes current WCAG 2 guidance and additional requirements. The list will change in future drafts.</p>
				<p>Unless otherwise stated, requirements assume the content described is provided both visually and programmatically.</p>
			</details>
		
			
			<div class="ednote">
			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. To meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance will be provided including functional categories of disabilities, general guidelines, outcomes that can be tested, a rich collection of methods, resource links, and code samples.</p>

				<p><strong> The following guidelines are an initial list of potential outcomes that the working group will be exploring. The goal is to guide the next phase of work. They should be considered drafts and should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3</strong>.</p>

			<p>Ordinarily, exploratory content includes editor's notes listing concerns and questions for each item.  Because this Guidelines section is very early in the process of working on WCAG 3.0, this editor's note covers the content of the entire section.  Please consider all items in the list as exploratory at this point. It is a list of all possible topics for consideration. Not all items listed will become requirements.</p>

			<p>The outcomes listed below came from analysis of user needs that the Working Group has been studying, examining, and researching. They have not been refined and do not include essential exceptions or methods. Some outcomes may be best addressed by authoring tools or at the platform level. Many outcomes need additional work to better define the scope and to ensure they apply correctly to multiple languages, cultures, and writing systems. We will address these questions as we further explore each outcome.  </p>

			<p>Please consider the following questions when reviewing this list of outcomes:</p>


			<ul>
				<li>Does the structure proposed here and exemplified in the three developing outcomes help explain the relationship of requirements?</li>
				<li>What requirements are needed to make web content accessible and are missing from this list?</li>
				<li>What research supports or refutes these requirements?</li>
			</ul></p>

			<p id="additional_research"><strong>Additional Research</strong></p>
			<p>One goal of publishing this list is to identify gaps in current research and request assistance filling those gaps.</p>
			<p> Editor's notes indicate the outcomes within this list where the working group has not found enough research to fully validate the guidance and create methods to support it or additional work is needed to evaluate existing research.  If you know of existing research or if you are interested in conducting research in this area, please file a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag3/issues">GitHub issue</a> or send email to <a href="mailto:public-agwg-comments@w3.org?subject=WCAG%203.0%20public%20comment">public-agwg-comments@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-agwg-comments/">comment archive</a>). </p>

			<h2>Conformance</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>You might want to make a claim that your content or product meets the WCAG 3 guidelines. If it does meet the guidelines, we call this “conformance.” To conform to WCAG 3, your test results must show that your project is accessible.</p>
				<p>If you want to make a formal conformance claim, you must use the process described in this document. However, conformance claims are not required and your content can conform to WCAG 3, even if you don’t want to make a claim. You can still use this process to test your project’s accessibility.</p>	
				<p>There are two types of content in this document:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Normative:</strong> what you must do to meet the guidelines.</li>
					<li><strong>Non-normative:</strong> advice to help you meet the guidelines. This is also called <q>informative</q>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are a variety of ways to say what is required in WCAG 3. We are experimenting with different approaches. Once we have developed enough guidelines, we will test how well each works. Here are some of the ideas for WCAG 3 requirements:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Two ways of evaluating accessibility: 
					<ul><li>Outcomes are statements that can be tested.</li>
						<li>Assertions and procedures are statements that you used an accessible way to create the content that is hard to test.  Assertions are new and we are trying different rules for how they can work. </li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Outcomes have two (2) types of tests:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Quantifiable tests:</strong> Tests where there is a high degree of consistency between test results from different testers. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a value specified by the requirement.</li>
						 
						<li><strong>Qualitative tests:</strong> Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results may vary between testers who understand the criteria. An example is evaluating the quality of a requirement such as alternative text.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Tests can be applied to four (4) different scopes:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Item:</strong> A component or unit of content. Examples include a drop down menu, a media player, a phrase, or an image.</li>
						<li><strong>View:</strong> All content visually and programmatically available without a user-initiated substantive change.</li>
						<li><strong>User process:</strong> Series of user actions, and the distinct items and interactive views that support the actions, where each action is required to complete an activity.</li>
						<li><strong>Product:</strong> The aggregate of all related items, user processes, and views.</li>
					</ul></li>
					<li>Three different levels show how accessible the content is: bronze, silver, or gold level.</li>
					<li>Issue severity allows different rules for accessibility problems. Rules for problems that block people from using the content are stronger than rules for minor problems. </li>
					<li>Adjectival ratings allow testers to grade content using words (fail, pass, great) or numbers (1,2,3). This provides a scale that may better match what people with disabilities go through to use it. </li>
					<li>Percentages are used instead of requiring that accessibility be perfect or you fail.  </li>
					<li>Pre-assessment conditions are tests that coders can use to see if they are ready to start accessibility testing.  This is to help coders, not to make a new level of requirements. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>We intend to address the following topics in the future, but for now, you can skip them. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Conforming alternative version - whether WCAG 3 will allow having inaccessible content if there is also an accessible version. </li>
					<li>Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies - this is a complicated topic about different assistive technologies, their features, and the languages they are available in.</li> 
					<li>Defining conformance scope - WCAG 2.x defines scope as a web page. WCAG 3 will have a broader scope to include the modern web and applications. </li> 
					<li>Conformance requirements - what someone has to do to meet WCAG 3. </li>
					<li>Conformance claims – how to make a statement that you meet WCAG 3. </li>
				</ul>

			<section>
				<h2>Normative requirements</h2>
				<p>In addition to this section, the <a href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a> and <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> sections in WCAG 3 provide <a>normative</a> content and define requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as <q>non-normative</q>, diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>
				<p> The key words <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em>, <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em>, <em class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</em>, <em class="rfc2119">NOT RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em>, and <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</em> in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14">BCP 14</a> [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. </p>

			<section>
				<h2>Approaches to conformance</h2>
				<p>WCAG 3 will include a new conformance model to address a wider range of user needs, test a wider range of technologies and support new approaches to testing. We are exploring several approaches to conformance. After studying the comments on the previous draft, these are the concepts that showed promise.  We are giving an overview in this draft, but we continue to test the combination of the concepts.  </p>
				<p>There are several goals for this new conformance model:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Develop a model that encourages web sites to continue to improve accessibility (vs. stopping at the previous AA level);</li>
					<li>Better reflect the lived experience of people with disabilities, who successfully use sites that have some content that does not meet WCAG 2.0 AA, or who encounter barriers with sites that meet WCAG 2.0 AA; and</li>
					<li>Allow for bugs and oversight by content authors, provided the impact of them upon users with disabilities is not substantial. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>The proposed approaches can fit together in a variety of ways. We will be testing these approaches and others for <a>validity</a>, <a>reliability</a>, <a>sensitivity</a>, <a>adequacy</a>, <a>complexity</a> and <a>equity</a>. We welcome suggestions on ways to improve these approaches to better meet these criteria and concerns about how they might affect accessibility. The working group plans to select from or even replace these options based on feedback, prototyping, and testing. </p>
				<p>There are two main approaches to evaluating accessibility that are promising.  There are also detailed ideas that support these approaches. The two main approaches are: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Outcomes with tests</strong>: Outcomes are verifiable statements that allow testers to reliably determine if the content being evaluated satisfies the user needs identified in the Guideline. Outcomes are addressed in <a href="#outcomes">Section 3.3.1 Outcomes</a>. Tests are addressed in <a href="#testing-outcomes">Section 3.3.2 Testing Outcomes</a>. </li>
					<li><strong>Assertions and procedures:</strong>
						<em>Assertions</em> are attributable statements by a person or organization that they followed a <em>procedure</em> to improve accessibility. Assertions are addressed in <a href="#assertions">Section 3.4.1 Assertions</a>. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are additional ideas that support these two approaches and can be used or combined in many different ways. </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong><a href="#conformance-levels">Conformance levels</a>:</strong> Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels continue to receive positive feedback as an approach for overall conformance rating. </li>  
					<li><strong><a href="#issue-severity">Issue severity</a>:</strong> Outcomes may allow for the concept of varying severity. High severity issues are those which prevent users from completing user processes (tasks). </li>
					<li><strong><a href="#adjectival-ratings">Adjectival ratings</a>:</strong> Adjectival Ratings allow testers to grade a test, outcome, or guideline by an adjective rating (such as fail, pass, exemplary) or a numeric rating (such as 1-5) that potentially can be closer to the lived experience of a person with a disability. </li> 
					<li><strong><a href="#pre-assessment-checks">Pre-assessment checks</a>:</strong> Pre-Assessment checks are tests or criteria that implementers can use to determine if they are ready to assess conformance. The intent is to help organizations prepare for conformance testing, not to create a new level of conformance. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The details of these approaches change as we assemble them into a coherent whole.  This draft gives a high level overview of these approaches so we can give an update and receive feedback on the individual approaches we are considering.  </p> 

			<div class="ednote">
				<p>As we continue developing conformance, we seek input on the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Which option has the best chance of adoption and why?</li>
					<li>How well do these approaches support regulatory needs?</li>
					<li>How will these approaches be integrated into a conformance model (including levels or scores)?</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Next steps include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Further refine options,</li>
					<li>Test the validity, reliability, sensitivity, adequacy, complexity and equity of the various models using these approaches, and</li>
					<li>Write sample guidelines to test out each option.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Outcomes and methods</h3>
			<div class="ednote">
				<p>As we continue developing outcomes and methods, we seek input on how well the approach to outcomes, assertions and tests defined here supports additional requirements not addressed in 2.2.</p>
	
				<p>Next steps include:</p>
				<ul>	
					<li>Get feedback from designers, developers, and other communities on wording choice,</li>
					<li>Finalize names and descriptions of scope and tests,</li>				
					<li>Develop detailed examples of methods and tests,</li>
					<li>As we develop example outcomes and methods, further explore conditions  and how multiple measurements might be used to meet an outcome.</li>
					<li>Address all GitHub issues under <a href="https://github.com/w3c/silver/milestone/16" target="_blank">test types and terminology milestone</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<section>
			<h3>Outcomes</h3>
			<p>Outcomes are verifiable statements that allow testers to reliably determine if the content being evaluated satisfies the user needs identified in the Guideline. All outcomes and assertions that relate to a Guideline will be listed together to encourage adoption of higher levels of accessibility. </p>
			<p>Each outcome is associated with at least one <a>method</a>. Methods are informative and kept in how to documents. Each method contains techniques for meeting the outcome, examples, resources, and <a>sets of tests</a>  for evaluating the outcome. Methods can apply to a specific technology, such as HTML, or can be more generic where the advice applies no matter what technology, such as the methods supporting the Clear Language guideline. </p>

			<p>Outcomes are written so that testers can determine the accessibility of technologies based solely on the outcome, even when methods do not yet exist for those technologies.</p>

			<h4>Testing outcomes</h4>

			<section>
				<h5>Types of tests</h5>
					<p>WCAG 3 includes two (2) types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Quantifiable tests:</strong> Tests where there is a high degree of consistency between test results from different testers. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a value specified by the requirement.</li>

					<li><strong>Qualitative tests:</strong> Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results may vary between testers who understand the criteria. One example is evaluating the quality of alternative text used to meet a requirement for alternative text.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Most tests have prescribed ways to meet the test. In some cases, the ways to meet the test will change based on a specific condition being met (example: the human language of the content).</p>

				<p>Although content may satisfy all outcomes using quantifiable and qualitative tests, the content may not always be usable by people with a wide variety of disabilities. The assertions (see <a href="#assertions">Section 3.4.1 Assertions</a>) are designed to address this problem. </p>

				<section>
					<h6>Quantifiable tests</h6>
					<p>Quantifiable tests rely on measuring properties of the content based on nominal values. The test results are objectively verifiable, and avoid variation of test results between different testers. Values are quantifiable. They could be boolean (true/false), for example to check the presence of titles, text alternatives, and accessible names. Other values could include numerical thresholds; for example, to check color luminosity ratios.</p>
					<p>Each method using quantifiable tests includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the values being tested; and</li>
						<li>an algorithm to measure the properties of the content based on the values.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="example">
						<strong>Example quantifiable test</strong>
						<p>These tests are already part of WCAG 2.</p>
						<p>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/23a2a8/" target="_blank">Image has non-empty accessible name</a></p>
						<p>Example for 1.4.3: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/afw4f7/proposed/" target="_blank">Text has minimum contrast</a></p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h6>Qualitative tests</h6>
					<p>Qualitative tests rely on evaluating content based on a set of defined qualities and exceptions. The set of qualities and exceptions limit the scope of decisions, to minimize variation of test results arrived at by different testers. Still, some level of qualitative assessment is required, therefore the accuracy of the test results also depends on the knowledge and context of the testers to some degree.</p>
					<p>Each method using qualitative tests includes:</p> 
					<ul>
						<li>the defined qualities being tested; and</li>
						<li>guidance on evaluating how well the content meets the defined qualities.</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="example">
						<strong>Example qualitative test</strong>
						<p>These tests are already part of WCAG 2.</p>
						<p>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/qt1vmo/proposed/" target="_blank">Image accessible name is descriptive </a></p>
						<p>Example for 2.4.6: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/cc0f0a/proposed/" target="_blank">Form field label is descriptive</a></p>
					</aside>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Test scopes</h5>
				<p>Testing outcomes use <a>items</a>, <a>views</a>, <a>user processes</a>, and the <a>product</a> to define what is being tested.</p> 
	
				<p><dfn data-lt="item|unit" title="Smallest testable unit">Items</dfn> are the smallest testable unit. They may be interactive components such as a drop down menu, a link, or a media player. They may also be units of content such as a word, a phrase, a label or error message, an icon, or an image.</p>
	
				<p><dfn data-lt="views" title="All content visually and programmatically available without a substantive change.">Views</dfn> include all content visually and programmatically available without a substantive change. Conceptually, views correspond to the definition of a web page as used in WCAG 2, but are not restricted to content meeting that definition. For example, a view could be considered a “screen” in a mobile app or a layer of web content – such as a modal. </p>
	
				<p><dfn data-lt="user process" title="Series of user actions required to complete an activity">User processes</dfn> are a series of user actions, and the distinct interactive <a>views</a> and <a>items</a> that support the actions, where each action is required to complete an activity. A user process may include a subset of items in a view or a group of views.</p>
				<p>Examples of a process include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Logging into a web site and being recognized as an authenticated user;</li>
					<li>Ordering an item, in which case the process includes the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
					<li>Submitting tax information, from start to end of the process; and</li>
					<li>Interacting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A process is comprised of one or more <a>views</a> or subsets of views. Only the part of the views that support the user process are included in a test of the user process.</p>
	
				<p>The <dfn title="set of items, views, and user processes that comprise the web site">product</dfn> is the combination of items, views, and user processes that collectively comprise the web site, set of web pages, web app, etc.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h5>Conditions</h5>
				<p>Some tests only apply in certain situations. Testing may occasionally require determining and referencing which specifications are being tested.  Methods will note whether a test always applies or under what conditions a test applies. Both quantitative and qualitative tests can be conditional. </p>



						<aside class="example">
							<p>Example conditions include:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>The language used may have  different grammatical rules which only apply to that language.</li>
							<li>An interface with multiple contrast modes may have different contrast requirements than an interface with only a default contrast mode.</li>

							<li>In situation A, text X may apply. In situation B, text Y may apply.</li>

			<h2>Assertions and procedures</h2>
			<div class="ednote">
				<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>

              added to the guidelines.</li>
					<li>What optional supporting documentation should organizations provide with an assertion?</li>
					<li>Is there a need for WCAG 3 to require proof of an assertion, and if so, what documentation should be required as proof?</li> 
						<li>Should assertions be dated, expire, or be reviewed on a regular basis?</li>
						<li>Can steps in a procedure duplicate tests in other parts of the guidelines? If so, how should those be handled?</li>
					<li>Can assertions exist outside of conformance? For example, can they be used as an internal benchmark rather than for a claim of conformance?</li>
					<li>Can assertions be used at the most basic level of conformance? If so, how?</li>

				<h3>Assertions</h3>
				<p>An assertion is a formal claim of fact, attributed to a person or organization. In WCAG 3, an [=assertion=] is an attributable and documented statement of fact regarding procedures practiced in the development and maintenance of the content or product to improve accessibility. </p>
				</section>

			<section>				
				<h4>Using assertions</h4>
				<p>Assertions may supplement [=methods=] in one or more outcomes. Assertions should only be used on outcomes and guidelines that allow assertions. Organizations can make an assertion that they followed a procedure to claim conformance. Results when testing assertions are true/false - the organization making the assertion either provided the required documentation or it did not.</p>

				<p>Procedures used in assertions may be implemented at the organization level, during design and development, or during testing.</p>

				<p>Examples of procedures that may be used during implementation might include:</p>
					<ul><li>Training,</li>
					<li>FTE (Full Time Equivalent) assignments,</li>
					<li>Skills testing,</li>
					<li>Coordination and documentation of accessibility processes, or</li>
					<li>Setting the priority for remediation.</li></ul> 

				<p>Examples of procedures that may be used to evaluate accessibility might include:</p>
					<ul><li>Usability testing,</li>
					<li>Heuristic evaluation, or</li>
					<li>Assistive technology testing.</li></ul>

			</section>

			<section>			
				<h4>Documenting assertions</h4>

					<p>Assertions must be documented as part of the conformance claim process.  The required information may also be made available through the web site.</p> 

					<p>Assertions might include the following information:</p>
						<ul><li>The statement being asserted,</li>
						<li>The date of the assertion,</li>
						<li>The date or date range the procedure was completed,</li>
						<li>The scope of the assertion,</li>
						<li>Contact information for the person or group making the assertion, and</li>
						<li>The outcome(s) or guideline(s) supported by the assertion.</li></ul>

				<p class="ednote">An alternative to specifying assertions at the outcome or guideline level might be to require the assertion apply to the scope of the conformance claim.</p>
			</section>

			<section>			
				<h4>Supporting documentation for assertions</h4>
				<p>WCAG recommends maintaining additional information that an organization can use to improve or validate procedures and assertions. WCAG  will not require organizations to provide supporting documentation to conform.</p>
			</section>

			<section>			
				<h4>Testing assertions</h4>
				<p>The quality of an assertion can be tested based on how well the assertion meets the documentation requirements for assertions (See <a href="#documenting-assertions">Documenting Assertions</a>). Conforming to WCAG does not require testing supporting documentation; however, organizations may decide to adopt additional documentation requirements based on the procedure being asserted. </p>

				<h3>Conformance levels</h3>

				<p>WCAG 3 defines three levels of conformance: bronze, silver, and gold. While it is easy to replicate the WCAG 2 A, AA, AAA by renaming the levels, there is an opportunity to improve accessibility for people with disabilities by using a more advanced approach.  </p>
				<p><strong>Bronze</strong> is the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3. To reach Bronze level, the scope claimed in the conformance statement must pass a subset of outcomes and assertions. The subset will require enough outcomes and assertions to improve equity across <a>functional needs</a>.</p>

				<p><strong>Silver</strong> level incentivizes organizations to go further to improve accessibility. One possibility that we are examining is that Silver level points can accumulate even prior to completing bronze but are not usable until Bronze is achieved. The goal is to encourage organizations to go beyond the minimum, especially where organizations want to be recognized for their efforts to go beyond minimum accessibility. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Gold</strong> level identifies measures we want to include for those organizations that do achieve Silver so that some can stand out as exemplary, cutting edge, and role models. There are a number of ideas that will be developed further once more of the conformance structure is solidified. </p>
				</section>					
				<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Issue severity</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>Severity rating could contribute towards scoring and prioritization. </p> 
						<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Is every issue critical to someone, making this concept invalid?</li>
							<li>How best to assign severity, particularly if testers have different ideas on what is critical?</li>
							<li>How do we incorporate context/process/task? Is that part of scoping, or issue severity? Both are important to the end result.</li>
							<li>What to do with non-critical issues?</li>
							<li>If included, how will situations where severity depends on context be handled?</li>
							<li>Can the matrix inform designation of functional categories? For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2021/outcomes/text-alternative-available">Text Alternative Available outcome</a>.</li>
							<li>How will issue severity fit into levels? For example:<ul>
									<li>“Bronze” could be an absence of any critical or high issues;</li>
									<li>“Silver” could be an absence of any critical, high, or medium issues.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>How to account for cumulative issues becoming critical?</li>
							<li>Would another approach be more effective, for example assigning critical issues after testing is complete based on task or type of task rather than by test?</li>
						</ol>
				<p>Next steps include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Testing the assumption that some failures cause a greater impact to users than others or whether all guidelines and contexts are important to some individuals.</li>
					<li>Explore whether the concept of issue severity can be applied consistently and effectively. </li>
				</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Outcomes may allow for the concept of varying severity. High severity issues are those which prevent users from completing user processes (tasks). </p>
				<p>Tests could include critical issues. Each test could have a category of severity, so some tests will be flagged as causing a critical issue.</p>

				<h3>Adjectival ratings</h3>
				<p><a>Adjectival Ratings</a> allow test results to go beyond Pass or Fail to show progress towards a goal or exceeding a goal. Example of Possible adjectival ratings are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fail, Pass, Exceptional; or</li>
					<li>Fail, Progress, Pass, Better, Exceptional.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Outcomes or guidelines could be evaluated using adjectival ratings on both directly <a href="#quantifiable-tests">quantifiable</a> outcomes and <a href="#qualitative-tests">qualitative</a> measures that are asserted. Outcomes might be assigned an adjectival rating based on methods used to meet the outcome and issue severity. Guidelines might be assigned an adjectival rating based on the outcomes and assertions completed under the guideline. </p>

				<h3>Percentages</h3>
				<div class="ednote">
				<p>We are exploring whether percentages could apply to Bronze but have not found a model to date where this works without adding complexity and time needed for testing. </p>
				<p>As we continue developing this content, we seek input on the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How can percentages be used in a way that is equitable across disabilities? </li>
				</ul>
				</div>
				<p>In this approach, percentage of outcomes and assertions passed or percentage passed at a certain adjectival rating might be used to conform to Silver and Gold levels. </p>

				<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Pre-assessment checks</h3>
				<p>Pre-Assessment checks are tests or criteria that implementers can use to determine if they are ready to assess conformance.  The intent of specifying these would be to help implementers prepare for conformance testing, not to create a new level of conformance. Examples of pre-assessment checks might be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The video player used has the ability to display captions and support multiple audio tracks,</li>
					<li>All non-text elements on a page have an accessible name.</li>

					<h3>Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies</h3>
					<div class="ednote">
						<p>The intent is for the responsibility of meeting requirements to vary depending on the level of conformance.</p> 
						<p>At the basic/lower levels of conformance assumptions can be made by authors that many requirements can be met by user-agents and assistive technology. At higher levels of conformance the author may need to meet a requirement, or check that available user-agents do meet the requirements, or a combination of both.</p>
	
						<p>This approach means the working group will ensure that methods and techniques included do have reasonably wide and international support from user-agents, and there are sufficient techniques to meet each outcome.</p>
	
						<p>The intent is that WCAG 3 will use a content-management-system to support tagging of methods/techniques with support information. There should also be a process where interested parties can provide information </p>
	
						<p>Informative documentation that will be associated with this section includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>How to assess which assistive technologies you should support, for the "accessibility support set". This could be taken up by regulators to provide this information for a region.</li>
						</ul>
	
						<p>The exception is still being discussed to avoid people using that scenario when not appropriate.</p>
	
						<p>We continue to explore how the WCAG 2 concept of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc4">accessibility-supported</a> fits into proposed conformance models.</p>
	
					</div>
					<p>Author responsibility for accessibility support (or "Assistive Technology Support") varies by conformance level.</p>
					<section>
						
						<h4>Pre-requisite / Baseline conformance / Bronze</h4>
						<p>At lower levels of conformance authors can assume the methods and techniques provided by WCAG 3 will be sufficient to meet that level of conformance.</p>
	
						<p>The techniques provided as part of WCAG 3 documentation are marked at this level, and can be assumed to work.</p>
					</section>
	
					<section>
						<h4>Enhanced / Silver</h4>
						<p>Part of claiming conformance at higher levels includes defining which user-agents and assistive technologies you test for support, your "accessibility support set".</p>
						<p>Methods and techniques at the higher levels of conformance include some information about Assistive Technology compatibility. If the provided coverage is not sufficient for your "accessibility support set", or you need to use a different technique to meet the outcome, the author is responsible for testing that their technique works for the "accessibility support set".</p>
					</section>
	
					<section>
						<h4>Exceptions (at Enhanced / Silver level)</h4>
						<p>If there is a particular assistive technology which is in your "accessibility support set", and it has had a bug for more than 2 years, the author can claim an exception. In circumstances where most technologies support a technique but one does not for significant time, authors can still claim conformance.</p>
					</section>
	
	
				</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Defining conformance scope</h3>
				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, WCAG 3 requires the outcomes apply to a specific scope. While the scope can be an all content within a digital product, it is usually one or more sub-sets of the whole. Reasons for this include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Large amounts of content are impractical to evaluate comprehensively using anything beyond <a>automated evaluation</a> of items;</li>
					<li>In many cases, content changes frequently, causing evaluation to be accurate only for a specific moment in time;</li>
					<li>Some content is more important to the majority of users than other content; and</li>
					<li>Content that mostly meets the requirements but has problems can interfere with the user’s ability to complete a process.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>WCAG 3 therefore defines two ways to scope content: <a>views</a> and <a>processes</a>. Evaluation is done on one or more complete views or processes, and conformance is determined on the basis of one or more complete views or processes. </p>
				
				<p>Conformance is defined only for <a>processes</a> and <a>views</a>. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one process and view, a series of processes and views, or multiple related processes and views. All unique steps in a process MUST be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process MAY also be included in the scope.</p>
				<p class="ednote">We recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.</p>

				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>For technology to <a>conform</a> to WCAG 3, the following conformance requirements apply:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> - Content MUST meet the requirements of the selected <a href="#conformance-levels">conformance level</a>.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section data-status="exploratory">
				<h3>Conformance claims</h3>
				<p>Conformance claims are not required. Authors can conform to WCAG 3 without making a claim. The material below describes how to make a conformance claim if that option is chosen.</p>
				<section><h4>Required components of a conformance claim</h4><p>A conformance claim MUST include the following information:</p><ol>
					<li><b>Date</b> of the claim;</li>
					<li><b>Guidelines title, version and URI</b>
						<q>W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3.0 at https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/</q></li>
					<li><b>Conformance level</b> satisfied: (bronze, silver, or gold);</li>
					<li><b>A concise description of the views and processes</b>, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including any state changes which lead to a new view; and</li>
					<li>The technology including the hardware, software, and assistive technology used to test the claim.</li>
				</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Example conformance claim</h4>
					<p>On 12 August 2020, the following 10 views and 2 processes conform to WCAG 3 at a bronze level. Processes were selected because they are the most common activities on the web site and include 4 unique views. The other 6 views are the most commonly used.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Process 1: Order Newsletter (<a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a>, www.example.com/newsletter)</li>

			<h3>User-generated content</h3>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>User-generated content is content written by the public and customers. WCAG 3.0 may use different advice or steps for user-generated content to improve accessibility than for content created by the publisher. WCAG 3.0 proposes that organizations identify user-generated content and identify the steps taken to encourage accessibility. </p>
			</details>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>It remains to be determined how to address user-generated content that has accessibility issues; and to define what minimum thresholds might be acceptable. We expect WCAG 3 to provide this guidance within individual guidelines and outcomes and to support testing for conformance. The working group is looking at alternative requirements to apply to user-generated content guideline by guideline, and is seeking feedback on what would serve as reasonable requirements on how to best support accessibility in user-generated content with known (or anticipated) accessibility issues. </p>
					<p>One example would be “alternative text”. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) has specific guidance for providing a mechanism for alternative text. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b23">ATAG 2.0 Guideline B.2.3</a> - “Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content” could be adapted to provide specific, guideline-related guidance for user generated alternative text. </p>
					<p>The working group intends to more thoroughly address the contents and the location of an accessibility statement in a future draft.</p>
				</div>
			<p>Web content publishers may include content provided by the users of their digital products. We refer to such content as “<a href="#user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>”.</p>
			<p>Examples of user-generated content include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>social media postings and comments,</li>
				<li>uploaded photographs, or</li>
				<li>uploaded videos or other multimedia.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>User-generated content is provided for publication by visitors where the content platform specifically welcomes and encourages it. User-generated content is content that is submitted through a user interface designed specifically for members of the public and customers. Use of the same user interface as an authoring tool for publication of content by agents of the publisher (such as employees, contractors, or authorized volunteers) acting on behalf of the publisher does not make that content user-generated content. The purpose of the user-generated content conformance  section is to allow WCAG 3 outcomes and methods to require additional or different steps to improve the accessibility of user-generated content.</p>
			<p>An important part of WCAG conformance is the specific guidance that is associated with individual WCAG 3 guidelines and outcomes. Not all WCAG 3 guidelines will have unique outcomes and testing for user-generated content. Unless user-generated content requirements are specified in a particular guideline, that guideline applies as written whether or not the content is user generated. </p>
		
			
			<p>The web content publisher should identify all locations of user-generated content (such as commentary on hosted content, product descriptions for consumer to consumer for sale listings, and restaurant reviews) and perform standard accessibility evaluation analysis for each. If there are no accessibility issues, the user-generated content is fully conforming.</p>
			<section>
				<h4>Steps to conform</h4>
				<p>If accessibility issues are identified, or if the web site author wants to proactively address potential accessibility issues that might arise from user-generated content, then all of the following must be indicated alongside the user-generated content or in an accessibility statement published on the web site or product that is linked from the view or page in a consistent location:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Clearly identify where user-generated content can be found on the publisher’s digital product (perhaps by id href);</li>
					<li>Clearly identify the steps taken to encourage accessibility in user-generated content such as prompting the user for alternative text for their uploaded images before they are accepted and prohibiting text attributes except as they are part of semantic markup such as strong, headings, etc.;</li>

			<h2>Guidelines development methodology</h2>
			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>WCAG 3 includes some of the information from WCAG 2, guidelines for tools to create web content (ATAG), and guidelines for browsers, media players, and similar software (UAAG).  The WCAG 3 design is based on research. You can read more about the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">Requirements for WCAG 3.0</a>.  
</p>
			</details>
			<section>
				<h3>Relationship to other W3C guidelines</h3>
				<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> [[WCAG20]] were designed to be technology neutral, and have stayed relevant for over 10 years. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]] provide guidance for various types of software that assist people in writing accessible content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] offers useful guidance to user agent developers and has been implemented on an individual success criterion basis.</p>
				<p>These guidelines have normative guidance for content and helpful implementation advice for authoring tools, user agents, and assistive technologies.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WCAG 3 incorporates but may not be all encompassing of WCAG 2, ATAG, and UAAG.</li>
					<li>WCAG 3 is not backward compatible with WCAG 2, ATAG 2.0, and UAAG 2.0.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Goals and requirements</h3>
				<p>The goal of WCAG 3 and supporting documents is to make digital products including web, ePub, PDF, applications, mobile apps, and other emerging technologies more accessible and usable to people with disabilities. It is the intention for WCAG 3 to meet this goal by supporting a wider set of user needs, using new approaches to testing, and allowing more frequent maintenance of guidelines to keep pace with accelerating technology change. The hope is that WCAG 3 will make it significantly easier for both beginners and experts to create accessible digital products that support the needs of people with disabilities.</p>
				
				<p>Research and design work performed by the Silver Task Force identified key requirements needed to improve upon the existing WCAG 2 structure. These requirements, presented in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">Requirements for WCAG 3</a> document, shaped the guidelines that follow and should be taken into account when evaluating and updating the guidelines.</p>

			<h2>Differences from WCAG 2</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Outcomes</h3>
				<p>Outcomes are different from WCAG 2 success criteria. Compared to success criteria, outcomes are written to be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In plain language; </li>
					<li>More understandable by people who are not experts in technology;</li>
					<li>More user-need oriented instead of technology oriented;</li>
					<li>More granular, so there will be more of them; and</li>
					<li>More flexible to allow more tests than the true/false statements of WCAG 2. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>The design of outcomes allows more varied needs of people with disabilities than could have been included in WCAG 2. </p>
				<p>Methods map approximately to WCAG 2 Techniques documents.</p>
